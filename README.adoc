= Creating a RESTful web service with contexts and dependency injection

Learn how to build a REST service with JAX-RS, CDI, and Open Liberty.

== What you'll Learn

You will learn how to build a simple inventory management application using JAX-RS and CDI. This
application acts as an `inventory` service, storing the information about various JVMs running on
different hosts. The `inventory` service has an entry for a particular host if that host exposes its
JVM's system properties via another RESTful web service, which you can refer to
as the `system` service. The `inventory` service communicates with the `system` service whenever
it does not contain an entry for a particular host to retrieve that host's JVM information. Once
an entry for a host is made, that host no longer needs to expose its JVM's system properties as they
would be recorded in the `inventory` service and can be accessed directly from it. At that point, the
host can stop its `system` service.

You will use JAX-RS to build your REST services and CDI to inject dependencies and manage the lifecycle
of your objects.

The `system` service that you will use is the same RESTful web service that you built in
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service].
Feel free to use your own, but a complete implementation is provided for you under `start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/system`.

The following diagram shows the overall layout of the inventory application:

[#diagram]
.When a request is sent to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/{hostname}, the `inventory` service first checks if the inventory has an entry for the specified hostname. If it does not, the `inventory` service attempts to talk to `system` service running on hostname to retrieve its JVM system properties. These properties are then stored in the inventory.

=== What is CDI?

Contexts and dependency injection (CDI) is a set of services that bring together enterprise Java beans and
JavaServer Faces technology in web applications.

With CDI, the container does all the daunting work of instantiating dependencies, giving us, the developers,
the ability to inject components into an application in a typesafe way. Moreover, CDI also makes it
possible to bind the lifecycle and interactions of stateful components to well-defined contexts,
controlling exactly when and how these components are instantiated and destroyed.


// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

// include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the git repository and use the starting project
that is provided in the `start` directory. To do this, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-cdi-intro.git
cd guide-cdi-intro/start
----

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished inventory application. Feel
free to give it a try before you proceed with building your own.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts. This is the staring point of the `inventory`
service and it displays the current contents of the inventory. As you might expect, these are empty since
nothing is stored in the inventory yet. Next, point your browser to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/localhost.
You see a JSON with the system properties of your local JVM. By visiting this URL, these system
properties are automatically stored in the inventory. Go back to http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts and
you see a new entry for `localhost`. For simplicity, only the OS name and username are shown here for
each host. You can repeat this process for your own hostname or any other local machine that is running
the `system` service.

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.


== Creating the inventory management application

First, let's break down the different components your application will be made out of, as well as which
technologies each component will use.

1. You will need some kind of inventory manager that edits the inventory contents, adding new entries,
removing old entries, and so on. This component will use CDI so that it can be used as an injectable bean.

2. You will need a means of establishing communication between the client and the inventory manager.
This can be done using a RESTful web service. You will build this service using JAX-RS and inject the
inventory manager bean into it using CDI.

3. Finally, you will need some kind of wrapper for all of your RESTful web services (or just one such
  service in this guide). You will use JAX-RS to create this wrapper class.

While it was not mentioned yet, JSON-P will be used to process all JSON resources provided by the two
services.

=== Creating the inventory manager bean

The inventory manager bean is responsible for storing and retrieving various JVM system properties.

For this bean, use a simple Java Collection to store JSON objects. A more advanced application should
use a database to persist all the data, but in this example it's not necessary.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryManager.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryManager.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

Your inventory is ultimately just a `ConcurrentMap` object where the key is a hostname and the value
is a JSON Java object full of various JVM system properties.

The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation on the class is a part of CDI and it indicates that this particular
bean is to be initialized once per the application scope. Intuitively, since the `ConcurrentMap` object
is essentially our database, we want the inventory manger bean to be persistent between all the clients.
By making it application-scoped, the container ensures that the same instance of the bean is used whenever
its injected in the application.

Your inventory manager bean contains three simple methods for retrieving (`get`) entries from the inventory,
adding (`add`) entries to the inventory, and listing (`list`) all entries currently stored in the inventory.

Use JSON-P to process all of the JSON objects.

Finally, we are giving you two utility components: a `InventoryUtil` class and the `JsonMessages` enum.
Both of these can be found under `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/util`.

- The `InventoryUtil` class is responsible for communicating with the `system` service to retrieve JVM
system properties for a particular host that exposes them.
- The `JsonMessages` enum is used to build JSON Java objects for various error cases. Currently its
only used to build an error JSON whenever a particular host does not exist or is not running the `system` service.

Both of these contain detailed Javadocs, so feel free to read them for reference.


=== Creating the inventory resource

Create a JAX-RS service that is served at the `hosts` endpoint. This class will enable the client to
communicate with the inventory manager via HTTP methods.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryResource.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=**;!copyright]
----

First and foremost, the `@Path` annotation on the class indicates that this service is served at the `hosts`
endpoint.

The `@RequestScoped` annotation on the class is a part of CDI and it indicates that this bean is
to be initialized once for every request. In other words, the bean is instantiated when the request
is received and destroyed when a response is sent back to the client. Note that while this bean can
also be application-scoped, request scope is short-lived and is therefore ideal for HTTP requests.

The `@Inject` annotation indicates a dependency injection. In this case, you are injecting your `InventoryManager` bean.
This injects the bean in its specified context (application-scoped) and makes all of its functionalities
available without the need of instantiating it yourself.

The `@GET` annotation on a method is a part of JAX-RS and it indicates the type of HTTP request that
the method handles. GET requests always respond with some type of resource. In this case, both methods
respond with a JSON object which is indicated by the `@Produces` annotation.

The `@Path` annotation on a method is a part of JAX-RS and it indicates the endpoint at which the
HTTP request is handled. If the `@Path` annotation is omitted, the endpoint for the method will be the
same as the endpoint for the class. Additional curly braces can be used in the `@Path` annotation to treat the
endpoint as a parameter, which is then bound in the method signature using the `@PathParam` annotation.
You can see these annotations used in the `getPropertiesForHost` method signature.

Let's break down the methods:

- `getPropertiesForHost` returns the JVM system properties for the specific host by calling the injected
`InventoryManager` bean.
- `listContents` returns a JSON with the current contents of the inventory. This method also calls
the injected `InventoryManager` bean.

These two methods make up your basic REST service.

=== Creating the JAX-RS application

The last piece that you need is a JAX-RS application. This is a small wrapper class which groups all resources
under a common endpoint.

Create `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryApplication.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/rest/inventory/InventoryApplication.java[tags=**;!copyright]
----

The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is a part of JAX-RS and it indicates the common endpoint under which
all resources are grouped. In this case, everything is grouped under `inventory`. This makes
the starting point of your `inventory` service to be http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts.

The `getPropertiesForHost` method is then served at http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/\{hostname}
and the `listContents` method at http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts (since it didn't have a defined `@Path` annotation).

Your inventory application is now finished.


// =================================================================================================
// Building the application
// =================================================================================================

// == Building the application
//
// To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal form the command line:
//
// ```
// mvn install
// ```
//
// This goal builds the application and creates a `.war` file in the target directory. It also configures
// and installs Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.
//
// If the server is running, running the installation can cause issues because the installation attempts
// to start a server. You can instead run the following command:
//
//
// // =================================================================================================
// // Starting the application
// // =================================================================================================
//
// == Starting the application
//
// To start your inventory application run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal from the command line:
//
// ```
// mvn liberty:start-server
// ```
//
// This will start an Open Liberty server on your machine. Your POM is already configured to start the
// `inventory` and `system` services in this server instance. These can then be accessed at:
//
// - http://localhost:9080/inventory
// - http://localhost:9080/system
//
// After making changes to the code, use the Maven `package` goal to rebuild the application and have the
// running Open Liberty server pick up these changes automatically:
//
// ```
// mvn package
// ```
//
// To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal from the command line:
//
// ```
// mvn liberty:stop-server
// ```

== Building and running the application

// include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

To build the application and run it inside Open Liberty, execute the following Maven goals from the
command line:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Your POM is already configured to start the `inventory` and `system` services in this server instance.
These can then be accessed at:

- http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
- http://localhost:9080/system/properties

// include::{common-includes}/mvnpackackge.adoc[]

After making changes to the code, use the Maven `package` goal to rebuild the application and have the
running Open Liberty server pick up these changes automatically:

```
mvn package
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal from the command line:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```


// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the inventory application

While you can test your application manually, you should rely on automated tests since they will trigger
a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment
for you to write tests.

Begin by creating a test class `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java`:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testClass;!copyright;!tests;!helpers]
----

The `@BeforeClass` annotation is placed on a method that executes before any of the test cases.
In this case, the `oneTimeSetup` method retrieves the port number for the Open Liberty server and builds
a base URL string that is used throughout the tests.

The `@Before` and `@After` annotations are placed on methods that execute before and after every test case.
These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the `setup` method
creates a JAX-RS client which makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service. This client must
also be registered with a JSON-P provider (`JsrJsonpProvider`) to process JSON resources. The `teardown`
method simply destroys this client instance.

Next, add a few test case methods to test the functionality of your inventory application. Start by
creating a method that verifies that the inventory is initially empty when the server first starts up:

Create `testEmptyInventory()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testEmptyInventory]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that a host is correctly added to the inventory.

Create `testHostRegistration()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testHostRegistration]
----

Next, create a method that verifies that the JVM system properties returned by the `system` service match
the ones stored in the `inventory` service.

Create `testSystemPropertiesMatch()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSystemPropertiesMatch]
----

Finally, create a method that verifies that an unknown host or a host that does not expose their JVM system
properties is correctly handled as an error.

Create `testUnknownHost()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testUnknownHost]
----

To force these test cases to execute in a particular order, put them in a test "suite" method and label
it with a `@Test` annotation so that it automatically executes when your test class run.

Create `testSuite()`:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSuite]
----

One last bit is to add the unimplemented helper methods that are used throughout the tests:

[source, Java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java[tags=helpers;!javadoc]
----

Complete Javadocs for these helper methods are available under the `finish` directory for reference:
`finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointTest.java`.


=== Running the tests

// include::{common-includes}/mvnverify.adoc[]

If the server is still running from the previous steps, stop it first using the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Then, verify that the tests pass using the Maven `verify` goal:

```
mvn verify
```

It may take some time before build is complete. If the tests pass, you will see an output similar to the following:
